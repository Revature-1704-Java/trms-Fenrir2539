Tuition Reimbursement Management System
The TRMS is being developed to replace an email based system.
Employees will be able to submit work related reimbursement requests
for event such as certification and university courses. Managers will be able
submit their own reimbursements as well as approve or deny requests from their
employees. This system aims to make the reimbursement process faster, easier, and
maintain a robust record of data easily accessible.
